### Business Model: Please explain the company’s business model and value proposition. What is the pain point that your business addresses? What products or services will the company provide? How do you expect to monetize the product? (200 words max)

Verifying African customers online is either none existent or highly inaccurate in most countries, due to insufficient/inaccurate data, poor technological infrastructure and/or individuals possessing multiple identities. Businesses and  institutions in and out of Africa therefore originating and trusting transactions with Africans leaving the continent behind.

Finnager provides accurate data and online verification. Finnager technology can query multiple data sources in real time and uses advanced machine learning techniques to generate one time challenge questions that increase the verification accuracy above 97% and remove the impact of multiple identities. Businesses get a trust guarantee that's on par with the best worldwide. 

Finnager's data management software is owned by data providers on-premise giving them full control of their data and compliance. The Finnager query engine is decentralized and doesn't write or store any data. It never asks the same question twice.  This mitigates any security risks that other systems have. It can be integrated as API or widget.

Our model is very simple. A business pays per transaction to verify a person. Then we take a cut and give a portion to the data provider we use in that specific transaction. We also have bulk and enterprise models. 

### Opportunity: Describe your target customer segment and the size of your addressable market. Can the business model be expanded beyond your current city or country? How do you expect this market to grow over the next 3 to 5 years? What sort of market share do you believe your company can achieve over this period? (200 words max)



Finnager targets businesses that need to verify their customer or need identity risk management and fraud detection and prevention. These include banks, loan providers, insurance companies, governments that want to provide e-government services. Finnager also targets general sellers or service providers who would typically need a photo ID for an in-person or over the counter transaction. These include liqor and medicine distributors. Housing providers and landlords, lease officers, police departments, credit card providers, department stores amongst many others.

We expect the size of  requests for identity verification in Africa to grow by more than 1900% as both governments and businesses start to provide e-services. Africa currently only accounts for less than 3% of the $8B online identity market but is expected to account for around 19% of a $25B market by 2022.

Most Africans countries have a growing middle class and millenial generation who are more than eager to transact online or provide services online but cannot due to current limitations.  Internet consumption is rising in Africa and many foreign institutions and businesses are now looking at Africa as the next frontier. Data monetization is also just starting. The market growth we are projecting is actually conservative.

### Proof of Concept: What will “success” look like for your business? Describe status of the business and any milestones that have been achieved (sales growth, profitability, awards, etc.…please share numbers when possible). What is the next major milestone / goal for the business? (200 words max)

Ideally we want to become the leader in online verification in Africa. As of today, we have licenses to operate in 5 different countries which we have used as our testing ground. We hope to fully launch in these countries in the next year. We would like to clear 5 million transactions within the first 2 years after full launch. We also project to be profitable by end of year two as we do not have many overheads, only a lot of marketing, education and evangelism to undertake. In our pilot that we did in South Africa with one bank and an MNO, we were cleared about 2 969 transactions in 2 weeks. As we sign up more banks and institutions and increase the capacity of our infrastructure, we believe we can meet the 5 million mark. Our accuracy within that trial was over 99% with only 18 cases being referred to manual screening or request for further documentation.

Our second phase of testing starts in April 2018 where we have signed up 53 entities in 5 different countries ( Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana). The entities range from banks, MNOs, police forces, government departments, loan providers, insurance companies and a few general sellers.

### Context: Do you benefit from any favorable regulatory, tax, political, or industry trends? Who are your major competitors / substitutes? What is your business’ or product’s competitive advantage vs. these competitors? (100 words max)

Our competitors are Experian, Trulioo, local credit bureaus and brick and mortar notaries.

Experian and Trulioo are the larger global players and they do not have Africa on their roadmap.  Also, they lack localized strategies and a core understanding of how African businesses operate. 

Local credit bureaus and notaries  archaic, slow, offline and inaccurate.You have to go in-store with your IDs. This still does not solve problems like multiple IDs per person. We are faster, modern, accurate, cheaper and seamless. Finnager is online and accessible, they aren't.

Our competitive advantages are our technology, team and first mover advantage.

### Team: Please describe your company’s organizational structure, including number of total employees. Please include information on each founder’s previous work experience and how involved each founder currently is in the business. What do you view as the key strengths of each founder and other key employees? (200 words max)

We have 3 founders and to date have been hiring other expertise as consultants and contractors. We are looking to get our first batch of full time employees in the coming year as we expand our pilot.

### Risks: What are the 3 biggest risks facing your business, and how do you mitigate them? (100 words max)

1) Security - All systems that handle data carry varying levels of risk. We do not store any data and all data is owned and managed by its providers. We do not have a single point of attack or failure, drastically alleviating any security fears.

2) Adoption - There is a natural pushback whenever technology is introduced. It takes some education on the administrators' part but we are thoroughly documenting every procedure to make it simple.

3) Bureaucracy - In Africa, this is always a challenge. So far we have presented enough value not to face much of it though. We remain hopeful
